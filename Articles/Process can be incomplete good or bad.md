Process can be defined as steps to accomplish a task in an efficient and reliable manner.
Processed can be good they may be incomplete or simply it could be bad. It all depends on what we are planning to do and how we are planning to execute it. I am using a credit card request to activation process to explain how we can have a good, incomplete or a bad process. Let’s assume that Step 1-7 is the best ways of getting this process done.


Step 1 Customer requests for a Credit Card.
Step 2 Application received
Step 3 Application is routed to the right desk
Step 4 Credit History Check
Step 5 Income verification for credit limit.
Step 6 Issue a credit card.
Step 7 Credit card activated.


Example of Good process:-
At a high level this process looks complete and it address every aspect from request to activation. This is a good process and it protects the credit card company to issue cards to reliable customers. It also reduces their risk and improves profitability.
Example of incomplete process:-
An incomplete process could be e.g if there is no Step 5. We will have the reliability of the process but at the time of setting limits we may exceed the limits of the customer. This will expose the credit card company to a higher risk.
Example of a bad process:-
How this good process can be a bad process. i.e. not working in the best interest of the Credit card company.

Step 1 Customer requests for a Credit Card.
The form for a credit card does not capture required information. Since it is a partial information, company will have to either use incomplete information or may have to request additional information from the customer. This adds time to the process. It increases the cost and time to process the application. It may cause a loss of a customer.

Step 2 Application received
I think there is lot of ways to have a bad process here also. For now we’ll focus on the core processes.

Step 3 Application is routed to the right desk
Once the application is received the mail room doesn’t have clear process of where to forward the mail. They may forward a business credit card request to individual credit card processing desk or vice versa. This could create lot of confusion and cause frustration for the customer.

Step 4 Credit History Check
Credit history check can be done in many ways. One could do it by checking single source or from multiple sources which could be more reliable. If the process is to check a source which was very reliable and now doesn’t have a history of good quality can cause lot of concerns for the company issuing Credit Cards and possibly bad customers.

Step 5 Income verification for credit limit.
Income verification can be done in many ways. One way is to accept what a customer has presented. Other way is to verify it with bank or employer. This is one of the most important check as it enables the Credit Card company to verify and better manage their risk. If this process is not done perfectly, there is a risk of a customer spending over the limit and is not able to pay the money on credit card.


Step 6 Issue a credit card.
If a clear process is not defined, there is a possibility of error while printing credit cards. The company may issue a Premium Credit card to a person who was only authorized for a ordinary credit card.



Step 7 Credit card activated.
There is a possibility of error in this process also... If correct information is not keyed into verification system the credit card cannot be activated.

Summary: - Processes are more sophisticated than we think. It needs to be clearly thought and very well executed. It is advisable to hire a person who is an outsider but should be assisted by the best people in the business. This gives opportunity to a person to question the existing setup and better the process. A person who has the best knowledge may over look some of the steps as they could be considered trivial. For a small focused task the person doing it is the best person to create a process.
