Today we are using more devices than we have used in the history of mankind. As a matter of fact.. when ever we want to do something .. we want it to be convenient, easy and have a sense of that it was done right in less time. I have been working on the web and user interaction data for many years.. It is all about helping to get users to be able to do what they intended to do. Be it search, Menu options , links , context based content , color highlights, images to get attention, helping them make right choices for them.

Mental Models, Usability, Visual design, User Interaction are some of the tools we would use to help a customer to accomplish their task and feel connected.

With machine learning in play we are able to process lot more data and find correlations in the data and figure out where a user is feeling constraint and lost.

Using Machine learning, statistics and Human intelligence we can come up with a way where for it is easy for customer to accomplish what they intended to it..

If customers is happy.. they buy more, they love you , they recommend you and become an evangelist of your product.. That is free marketing as we have made the user feel enchanted.. this in someways is the main goal for any company to exist. Following are some of the companies and their products that have freed us from the clunky way of doing things.. help us grow and make our life better which is essential for human growth and make this world a better place.

Amazon : "Buy Now with 1 click"
Apple : The Amazing Phone .
Google : The search results and the speed of search engine.
Tesla : The Amazing electric care

This can be accomplished by going deeper into the mind and the task to come-up with a better way of doing things in life.

This is an amazing field to study as there is no end to it and we can become a reason of happiness for our consumers.
