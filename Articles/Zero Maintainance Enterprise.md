I think we can never get rid of operational support. Then how is it possible to be a Zero maintenance enterprise.

Zero maintenance Enterprise is just a concept which leads a organization to minimize wasteful spending and leveraging its resources to maximum.

Following are some of the concepts which will lead to a lower cost of support and maintenance.

1) Design.
2) Self Service.
3) Talented Employees willing to work as a team.
4) Using AI and Agents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Design.
   
   It all starts with the design.. whether it's a Process or a Product.
    * Apple is known for it's Product design.
    * GE is known for processes and good products.
      
    (If a organization has good processes and a good product by design no one can stop that company to be the leader in its category.)

3) Self Service.
   
      Self Service can help a organization to minimize its support spending and make processes very direct. This helps a organization to reach a resolution quickly and in a efficient manner.


4) Talented Employees willing to work as a team.
   
    I think this is one of the must and most important traits of a Zero maintenance enterprise. This helps in the most productive environment and easy resolution to issue. This leverages the human resources     to maximum. Which in turn lower the cost of doing business. It also maximizes share holder value.

5) Agentic Worflows & AI Agents

   Now with agentic workflow tasks can be automated and with AI agents self healing and correction can be done without human intervention.
